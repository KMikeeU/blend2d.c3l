# C3 blend2d

> Note: This is a toy project for me to learn C interop in C3. Don't expect this to be a full-featured blend2d binding.

- Only tested on Windows, all platforms should work, but `manifest.json` needs to be updated.
- Build blend2d from source using the [Build Instructions](https://blend2d.com/doc/build-instructions.html)
- Place the resulting static library in the corresponding library folder (e.g. `windows-x64/blend2d.lib`)
